# Canola-Winnowing
This repository contains the scripts used in Mamet et al. Soil Biology and Biochemistry (in review).

The scripts available here are as follows:
1. The MAMETetal_SBB_importing_BIOM_data_prep.R script will import the BIOM file output from QIIME2 and output the files necessary to run through the selbal pipeline.
2. The MAMETetal_SBB_yield_stability.R calculates the Brassica napus yield performance metrics needed for the selbal pipeline.
3. The selbal pipeline is available here: https://github.com/sua474/Canola_Pipeline.
4. MAMETetal_SBB_post_selbal.R generates the data and completes the statistical analyses used in the manuscript.
5. MAMETetal_SBB_figures.R contains the code used to make most of the figures used in the paper and supporting information.
